# RV Home Assistant
In November of 2018, my Wife and I gave up our house and hit the road in the RV. We originally set out to do this for about two years and now are shopping for a different RV that could support our needs indefinitely. Everything in our home and now in the RV is built upon [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)
