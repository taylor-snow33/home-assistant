# RV Home Assistant
In November of 2018, my Wife and I gave up our house and hit the road in the RV. We originally set out to do this for about two years and now are shopping for a different RV that could support our needs indefinitely. .

Long before we gave up our sticks and bricks household we started down a path of home automation, security and monitoring. It was a fun hobby that eventually proved to be useful.
